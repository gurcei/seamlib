SPRING game
-----------

  - giving the game a sense of progression
    - naughty wolves have stolen all of Spring's toys from her room
      - to give to their evil overlords, onion cake and the algebra dragon!
      - each level gives you the chance to steal gems back from these overlords
      - After you steal 30 of their gems, these overlords will get angry and
      - might be willing to hand you back one of your toys, but only if you can
      - correctly answer one of their questions about either the MEGA65, or mathematics! :)

seam-sprite library
===================
- for inputs:
-   frame_number
-   x, y
- output:
-   draw desired frame at desired location

file format
===========
- BYTE : number of frames
  - frame 0 details:
    - BYTE : char-type (fcm/ncm)
    - BYTE : default palette slice (ncm-specific)
    - BYTE : char-width
    - BYTE : char-height
    - BYTE : 1st char-indices used by frame
      (we can infer that it uses chr-width x chr-height chars after this)
    - BYTE: number of bounding boxes
      - BYTE[4] : bounding box 1 coords
      - BYTE[4] : bounding box 2 coords
  - frame x details
    - ...
- BYTE : number of animations
  - anim 0 details:
    - BYTE : num of frames
    - BYTE[size] : list of frame indices
  - anim x details:
    - ...
- DWORD : number of bytes of pixel data for chars
  - BYTE[size] : pixel data
