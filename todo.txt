seam-sprite library
===================
- for inputs:
-   frame_number
-   x, y
- output:
-   draw desired frame at desired location

file format
===========
- BYTE : number of frames
  - frame 0 details:
    - BYTE : char-type (fcm/ncm)
    - BYTE : default palette slice (ncm-specific)
    - BYTE : char-width
    - BYTE : char-height
    - BYTE : 1st char-indices used by frame
      (we can infer that it uses chr-width x chr-height chars after this)
    - BYTE: number of bounding boxes
      - BYTE[4] : bounding box 1 coords
      - BYTE[4] : bounding box 2 coords
  - frame x details
    - ...
- BYTE : number of animations
  - anim 0 details:
    - BYTE : num of frames
    - BYTE[size] : list of frame indices
  - anim x details:
    - ...
- DWORD : number of bytes of pixel data for chars
  - BYTE[size] : pixel data
